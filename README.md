# AOC-With-Me

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [AbolfaZl RezaEi][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

Let's endup 2022 by solving **AdventOfCode** questions, drinking some coffee, and listening to our favorite musics. We don't have much README things here, you can clone the project and see the codes that solves every question in AdventOfCode2022.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
